The Gesture Controlled Mouse makes human-computer interractions simpler by using the camera and gestures to track your movements. It uses state of the art CNN models from the MediaPipe Library to use your camera to recognize your hand gestures. It works on windows and requires almost zero contact with the mouse or touchpad.
